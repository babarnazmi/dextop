To install ext go to Apps\Codaxy.Dextop.Showcase\client\lib and edit 
mklink-ext.bat.sample file. 

After you set proper path to Ext, rename the file to mklink-ext.bat and execute it as administrator.

Note: If ext folder already exists, delete it.

If you're on XP and or mklink does not work for you, unpack Ext JS to the ext folder.
