Dextop Remoting Features
=========================

Dextop offers powerful remoting features, which make client-server communication very simple and straightforward.

Some of the features are:

- Remote procedure calls using Ext.Direct
- Automatic JSON encoding/decoding (thanks to JSON.NET)
- File upload
- AJAX request handling
- Server notifications by polling or long-polling technique

IDextopRemotable Interface
---------------------------
*IDextopRemotable* interface is used to mark that class is remotable (can be accessed from the client side). 
IDextopRemotable object instances **live in the server memory** while needed during the session lifetime.
This way Dextop offers stateful programming model.

Classes implementing IDextopRemotable interface must implement the *InitRemotable* method. This method should be used to init and assign the Remote property 
and fill other configuration data needed for the client side.

	public virtual void InitRemotable(DextopRemote remote, DextopConfig config)
    {
        Remote = remote;
        config["title"] = "My Window";
    }

*Dispose* method should be used to dispose and release the Remote object.

	public virtual void Dispose()
	{
		if (Remote != null)
			Remote.Dispose();
	}

### Remote object

Remote property of IDextopRemotable provides access to the DextopRemote object. DextopRemote object provides ways for interacting with the client.
On the client side any object implementing the mixin *Dextop.remoting.Remotable* can use this.remote object to access the Remote part on the server side.

Use *Remote.Register* to register other remotable objects. After registration configuration is sent to the client to instantiate the object on the client side.

Use *Remote.RemoteHostTypeProperty* to specify the type of the object to be created on the client side. If not defined, RemoteHostTypeProperty is 
determined by using (mapping) the type name and the namespace of the remotable class.

Use *Dextop.create* method to instantiate the method on the client side.

	var win = Dextop.create(config, { /* put any additional config options here */});
	win.show();

Use *Remote.TrackDisposable* to track any disposable object which needs to be disposed together with its parent.

*DextopSession* is the root remotable object. On disposing the session, the whole tree of remotable children is disposed.

Remote procedure calls (RPC)
----------------------------

Use *[DextopRemotable]* attribute to mark that method is remotable. 
Don't forget that a class or its base has to implement IDextopRemotable interface.

	[DextopRemotable]
	public String GetHelloMessage(String name)
	{
		return String.Format("Hello, {0}!", name);
	}

On Dextop application startup (or preprocess time) JS proxy classes are generated.

Invoke the method from the client side like this:

	this.remote.GetHelloWorldMessage('Marko', {
		success: function(msg) { Dextop.alert(msg); },
		failure: function(response) { Dextop.alert(response.exception); }
	});

Automatic JSON encoding/decoding
--------------------------------

Dextop offers automatic JSON encoding/decoding in your RPC calls.

	[DextopRemotable]
	string DoLogin(Login login)
    {
        return "Hello " + login.Username + "!";
    }

    [DextopForm]
    class Login
    {
        [DextopFormField(allowBlank = false, anchor = "0")]
        public String Username { get; set; }

        [DextopFormField(inputType = "password", anchor = "0")]
        public String Password { get; set; }
    }

Now objects can be sent from the client side and they will be automatically decoded to the corresponding object type on the server side.

	doLogin: function () {
        var form = this.down('form').getForm();
        if (form.isValid())
            this.remote.DoLogin(form.getFieldValues(), {
                type: 'alert',
                scope: this,                
                success: function (result) {
                    this.close();
                    alert(result);
                }
            });
    }

File upload
-----------
Check the <a href="../../#FileUploadForm" target="_blank">File Upload Form</a> demo to see how to handle file uploads. 
Multiple files can be sent in the same time.

AJAX request handling
---------------------
Any class implementing IDextopRemotable can define its own http handler.
Define the handler in the InitRemotable method.

	public override void InitRemotable(DextopRemote remote, DextopConfig config)
    {
        base.InitRemotable(remote, config);
        Remote.OnProcessAjaxRequest = DownloadFileHandler;
    }

    void DownloadFileHandler(HttpContext context)
    {
        context.Response.ForceFileDownload("Hello.txt");
        context.Response.Output.Write("...");        
    }

On the client side use:
	
	this.remote.getAjaxUrl()

to get the url of the handler.
Use

	Dextop.downloadAttachment(this.remote.getAjaxUrl())

or

	window.open(this.remote.getAjaxUrl())

to file downloads.

Server notifications
--------------------
Dextop offers server-push messaging using the long-polling technique.

To send a message to the client side, use the *SendMessage* method:

	Remote.SendMessage(new { Time = Date.Now });

To handle the message on the client side, define the onServerMessage method.

	onServerMessage: function(msg) {
		//handle the message code
	}

Message can be any object. It will be JSON encoded/decoded before reaching the client.
