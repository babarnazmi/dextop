All Form Field Types
====================

This demo shows all form field types supported by Dextop.



### Remote Lookup Combo

When form is displayed combo store is not loaded and description lookup 
cannot be made. If description is available inside initial form data then
it is possible to use valueNotFoundField in the field attribute to 
specify the name of the field which holds the description for the current 
inital lookup value.


### Extending field funcionality

Generated form fields are limited to the number of options offered by the Dextop framework.
For full Ext JS feature support, *apply* options should be used with the *ItemFactory.getItems method.
In Dextop forms use itemsOptions configuration option to apply features to fields, 
like the example for adding a change listener on the combo in this demo.
