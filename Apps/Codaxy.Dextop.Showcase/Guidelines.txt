Showcase application guidelines
-------------------------------
Ultimate goal is to have a large number of demos from which developers can learn and where developers can contribute.

Goals:
# Demos should be really simple to write and should just work
# Demos should be used for playing with Dextop
# Demos should be used to copy-paste some code to other projects
# Demos should be easy to find
# Demos should be standalone and isolated from other demos
# Demos should be variously categorized 
	# Remoting, Forms, Grids, Lookups, Plugins ...
	# Beginer, Normal, Advanced
	# Code Snippet, Tutorial, Best Practice, Design Pattern, Feature
# Demos should have written explanation of important parts
# Viewing JS source of the demo should be possible
# Viewing CS source of the demo should be possible
# Demo application should be reusable
# Demos should look good on big screens
